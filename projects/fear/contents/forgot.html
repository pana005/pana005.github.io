      <h2 class="forgottitle">They Never Came Back...</h2>
  		<p class="content4">  My worst fear was the feeling of being forgotten… it still is. I had a lot of friends back in high school. I had two best friends, a guy and a girl. The “guy” was like my brother. We were in the same clubs and did almost everything together. Because he is a year older, he was also able to help me a lot on my academics. The “girl” was cute and sweet. I had a little crush on her, but I was too shy to confess. We had math class together, which was the most enjoyable class. Because I’m better at math, I would always offer to tutor her, while she helped me with my English and history assignments. She was special to me because she was always there when I needed help. I was shy and kept everything inside me, however, she can always read my mind and support me. Additionally, we would always meetup before morning classes with her friends to discuss assignments and just life in general. Life felt perfect back then until my two best friends met. I truly regret introducing them. <br>
      One Day, the girl wanted to join a club I was in, so I introduced her to the president, which was the guy. After that, the three of us became close and would chat every day. At the moment, I was happy that my two best friends were able to get along well. Until, one day, the guy and I had a little conflict on a project, he was mad that I was too distracted during work sessions by chatting with the girl. At first, I apologized about it, but things gone worse. He started picking on my skills and abilities and held meetings without me. Before I realized, he started using the girl and persuade her to go against me. She did not betray me because she knows me well, but she really wished the guy and I can stop fighting and be back being brothers. However, things just got worse, I realized the guy also has a crush on the girl, which was the reason he wanted me to be far away from her. He made up excuses that made all the club members dislike me, which forced me to quit and leave. I left. I was so mad that I shouted at the girl and accused her helping the guy. I still remember how she was scared and shocked. That was the last time we talk and saw each other. As time goes on, the guy wins. The girl and the guy became close because of club projects. The morning session with the girl ended on the day they started dating. As for the guy, he never stopped telling people how he hated me and reject admitting I was his best friend. I felt like I never existed. As for the girl, there was hope, but I messed up. I was so mad at her, so I ignored her on purpose until we have zero interactions. I felt forgotten by them. I was afraid to reach out to make up all the mistakes, so the guy and the girl never came back.</p>
